# Voice Recognition V2 **(WIP)**

## Feature
- Recognize 7 voice command 

## Terminology

- **record**
- **recognizer**
- **recognizer index**

## Introduce

## Quick Start

### Train

#### Use Arduino Sample

#### //Use Serial Adapter

### Application

## Protocol
The simplest way to play the Voice Recognition V2 module is to use this VoiceRecognition Arduino library. But for many **hackers**, this is far from enough, so we supply this protocol by which user can communicate with the Voice Recognition V2 module.
